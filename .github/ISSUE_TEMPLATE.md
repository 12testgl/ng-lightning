<!--
Thanks for raising an issue! (For *questions*, we recommend instead using https://stackoverflow.com and adding the 'ng-lightning' tag or ask in https://gitter.im/ng-lightning/ng-lightning)

To help us help you, if you've found a bug please consider the following:

* If you can demonstrate the bug using https://stackblitz.com, please do. Use the 'Stackblitz' button inside the component's examples in http://ng-lightning.github.io/ng-lightning/#/components.
* Make sure you include information about the browser, and which version of ng-lightning you're using

Reproductions should be small, self-contained, correct examples – http://sscce.org.

Occasionally, this won't be possible, and that's fine – we still appreciate you raising the issue. 
But please understand that ng-lightning is run by unpaid volunteers in their free time, and issues that follow these instructions will get fixed faster.

If you have a stack trace to include, we recommend putting inside a `<details>` block for the sake of the thread's readability:
