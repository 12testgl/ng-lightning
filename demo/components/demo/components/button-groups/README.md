Group a series of buttons together (on a single line) in a button gropup.

Use either `nglButton` or `nglButtonIcon` if your button is going to contain text or not.

To specify a different option for each button use `nglButtonRadio` where to define the `value` of a button when selected. The `value` can be anything from `string` to `object`.

If you need to specify a custom class when a button is selected you can define the `activeClass` property.
