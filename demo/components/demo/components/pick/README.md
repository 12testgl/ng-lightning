Make a group of elements behave like a set of radio buttons by using `nglPick` and `nglPickOption`. You can alternatively make them behave like a set of checkboxes, by attaching the `nglPickMultiple` directive.

If you need to specify a custom class when the element is currently selected you can define the `activeClass` property.
