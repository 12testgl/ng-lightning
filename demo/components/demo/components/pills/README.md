Pills are a way of visualizing options that have originated from free text.

Use the `nglPillImage` attribute on an element that is to be the icon before
the pill's label.

If `[removable]` is set to a false value then the the `X`
remove button will be omitted. If it is not omitted then clicking on it will
trigger the `remove` event for which the parent of the component may listen
and act accordingly.
