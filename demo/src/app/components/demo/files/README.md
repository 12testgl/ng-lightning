Files are a representation of content uploaded as an attachment.

Use a file to include an image or icon, optionally with a title.
Use `nglCrop` to the parent element of the image to apply cropping to the specified ratio, such as 16x9, 4x3 and 1x1.
Use `icon` to display an icon to the left of the title.
Use `overlay` to display caption as overlay to file image.
